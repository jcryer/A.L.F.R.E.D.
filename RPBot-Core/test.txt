12/07/2018 11:57:50 +01:00 - Shivraj: ping me when it starts, ig



12/07/2018 12:13:15 +01:00 - spoon: <@199996479161630720> he wants staff and to keep bot



12/07/2018 12:13:41 +01:00 - spoon: And he understands why he lost admin



12/07/2018 16:08:01 +01:00 - spoon: <@&312961839359328266>  everyone here?



12/07/2018 16:08:20 +01:00 - Shivraj: studying but ig I can chat while studying



12/07/2018 16:20:19 +01:00 - darkcrys: <@!139089329988435968> Su, to pick the conversation up again,  what was this then if not a rage leave?

Am I missing something



12/07/2018 16:20:47 +01:00 - spoon: oh



12/07/2018 16:22:40 +01:00 - spoon: i think it was less of a rage leave and more like... ehhhhhhhhhh. like post-regret? 
we both left cause we were upset, i think



12/07/2018 16:24:19 +01:00 - darkcrys: and that isn't a rage leave?



12/07/2018 16:24:39 +01:00 - spoon: rage leave to me is more of what paladin did



12/07/2018 16:24:50 +01:00 - darkcrys: So your OC dies and you leave?



12/07/2018 16:24:57 +01:00 - spoon: nah in the sense of



12/07/2018 16:25:03 +01:00 - spoon: "lets fight to the death"
"omg you killed me"



12/07/2018 16:25:25 +01:00 - Shivraj: ok, we're straying.

My point is, we should give him one more chance, now that he is more chill



12/07/2018 16:25:31 +01:00 - spoon: i cant put it into words properly, but i find the two different



12/07/2018 16:25:35 +01:00 - darkcrys: "let's stop big bad while I'm hostage and was threatend."

"Omg you killed me for trying to stop you."



12/07/2018 16:25:41 +01:00 - Shivraj: we've given plenty of people more chances than we gave him



12/07/2018 16:25:52 +01:00 - Shivraj: and he's had a clean record for what? 14 months?



12/07/2018 16:26:04 +01:00 - Shivraj: everyone has shitty times, I'm not saying promote him back to Admin



12/07/2018 16:26:21 +01:00 - darkcrys: No one has a clean record.



12/07/2018 16:26:25 +01:00 - Shivraj: but he atleast deserves a shot at earning his way back, which is to say, he should still be staff.



12/07/2018 16:26:27 +01:00 - Shivraj: Liam.



12/07/2018 16:26:38 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'll be honest, JC has a cleaner record than any of us here.



12/07/2018 16:26:51 +01:00 - spoon: ~~wrong. rp bot is the cleanest of us all~~



12/07/2018 16:26:55 +01:00 - Shivraj: shhhhh



12/07/2018 16:27:01 +01:00 - darkcrys: No I don't agree, he has left so many times



12/07/2018 16:27:03 +01:00 - darkcrys: for stupid shit



12/07/2018 16:27:12 +01:00 - spoon: back then we didnt have the warning system in place



12/07/2018 16:27:23 +01:00 - spoon: but anyway



12/07/2018 16:27:39 +01:00 - darkcrys: Does someone really have to tell you not to leave the server you are admin on at regular intervals



12/07/2018 16:28:12 +01:00 - spoon: i mean



12/07/2018 16:28:36 +01:00 - spoon: the server used to be a joke



12/07/2018 16:28:54 +01:00 - spoon: + the only difference between staff and admins used to be the colour



12/07/2018 16:28:56 +01:00 - spoon: before we joined admins



12/07/2018 16:29:13 +01:00 - darkcrys: And the same rule goes for staff



12/07/2018 16:29:33 +01:00 - Shivraj: What's wrong with giving him back staff, atleast?

Leaving is not as big an offense as many of the other things that he could've done. Not to mention, he was drunk, and we only formally told him once.

+ it wasn't that serious back then. No harm done, either. Server's going pretty strong, and nothing burned down when he left.



12/07/2018 16:30:08 +01:00 - darkcrys: I'm very sorry, but I don't believe he was drunk.



12/07/2018 16:30:13 +01:00 - darkcrys: Tipsy at most.



12/07/2018 16:30:23 +01:00 - Shivraj: You don't trust him?



12/07/2018 16:30:27 +01:00 - darkcrys: Have you seen alex type when he is drunk?



12/07/2018 16:30:34 +01:00 - spoon: people can be different types of drunk



12/07/2018 16:30:38 +01:00 - Shivraj: ^^



12/07/2018 16:30:40 +01:00 - darkcrys: yes I know



12/07/2018 16:30:44 +01:00 - darkcrys: You don't need to tell me



12/07/2018 16:30:56 +01:00 - darkcrys: but a "100% functioning drunk" is a type I have yet to see



12/07/2018 16:31:15 +01:00 - Shivraj: smh, sure, no need to trust him, ig



12/07/2018 16:31:52 +01:00 - spoon: so your argument is on the basis that he's lying about being drunk?



12/07/2018 16:32:00 +01:00 - darkcrys: nah



12/07/2018 16:32:00 +01:00 - Shivraj: I haven't even stood up for Eunice, even once, man. I'm standing up for him cause I believe it was an honest mistake.



12/07/2018 16:32:16 +01:00 - Shivraj: so, if we're pitting his and my word against yours, we're not really getting anywhere, are we?



12/07/2018 16:32:31 +01:00 - darkcrys: Yes I know, but that doesn't even matter



12/07/2018 16:32:53 +01:00 - Shivraj: We've given you many chances, why shouldn't we give him the same I gave you?



12/07/2018 16:33:00 +01:00 - spoon: how do you feel about him at least keeping his bot ownership + privileges?



12/07/2018 16:33:01 +01:00 - Shivraj: a week or so demotion



12/07/2018 16:33:08 +01:00 - darkcrys: the damage is done.

Drunkingly killing someone in a car accident still is manslaughter and not an accident.



12/07/2018 16:33:10 +01:00 - Shivraj: see how he fares



12/07/2018 16:33:14 +01:00 - spoon: ...



12/07/2018 16:33:18 +01:00 - spoon: liam



12/07/2018 16:33:20 +01:00 - spoon: what the fuck



12/07/2018 16:33:28 +01:00 - darkcrys: <@!124102469646024704> You gave me Zero changes



12/07/2018 16:33:33 +01:00 - Shivraj: lmao what?



12/07/2018 16:33:34 +01:00 - darkcrys: It was out of the blue demotion



12/07/2018 16:33:41 +01:00 - darkcrys: I had to beg for a second change.



12/07/2018 16:33:43 +01:00 - darkcrys: Beg



12/07/2018 16:34:32 +01:00 - Shivraj: whatever it was, I'm pretty sure I was pretty quick to change your punishment, my dude.

besides, why can't we give him the same treatment?



12/07/2018 16:34:36 +01:00 - Shivraj: there was no begging



12/07/2018 16:34:38 +01:00 - darkcrys: And I lost that chance to you appeasing Mitch and Tina.

I lost my OC out of the blue due to you appeasing them.

So do tell me how generous you were.



12/07/2018 16:34:49 +01:00 - spoon: keep this on topic



12/07/2018 16:35:01 +01:00 - darkcrys: <@!124102469646024704> want me to add you to tha convo where they tried to demote me



12/07/2018 16:35:10 +01:00 - darkcrys: and see how I had to convince and beg them ?



12/07/2018 16:35:25 +01:00 - Shivraj: See, I wasn't even a part of that.



12/07/2018 16:35:39 +01:00 - Shivraj: Again, I've said sorry many times, for that



12/07/2018 16:35:46 +01:00 - Shivraj: and I really am



12/07/2018 16:36:24 +01:00 - Shivraj: I really, really, genuinely see how foolish it was, now.

But, that's going off topic.



12/07/2018 16:36:32 +01:00 - darkcrys: it's fine, it's just I wasn't given the fairest treatment and you using that as argument set me off

As the only ones complain where the cancer squad and JC and Noire.



12/07/2018 16:36:39 +01:00 - Shivraj: my point is, why can't we give him a week or so and see how he fares



12/07/2018 16:36:56 +01:00 - darkcrys: Look he hasn't earned my trust



12/07/2018 16:37:02 +01:00 - spoon: ``su - Today at 4:33 PM
how do you feel about him at least keeping his bot ownership + privileges?``

<@!64751081975975936>



12/07/2018 16:37:14 +01:00 - darkcrys: I'll get to that in time.



12/07/2018 16:37:36 +01:00 - Shivraj: that's happening one way or another tbh.

We don't know how to manage the bot + add to it



12/07/2018 16:38:01 +01:00 - spoon: this is the priority imo



12/07/2018 16:38:05 +01:00 - darkcrys: Too be 100% honest.

We do not need and even if we did, dave has it and can figure out how to get it to work



12/07/2018 16:38:05 +01:00 - Shivraj: ^^



12/07/2018 16:38:13 +01:00 - Shivraj: no what



12/07/2018 16:38:14 +01:00 - darkcrys: I'm not doing a second mitch



12/07/2018 16:38:17 +01:00 - Shivraj: ^to Su



12/07/2018 16:38:25 +01:00 - darkcrys: We needed the xp mods back then



12/07/2018 16:38:28 +01:00 - darkcrys: and look what happend



12/07/2018 16:38:34 +01:00 - spoon: what?



12/07/2018 16:38:34 +01:00 - Shivraj: this is different, lad



12/07/2018 16:38:39 +01:00 - Shivraj: this is programming



12/07/2018 16:38:46 +01:00 - darkcrys: We don't need the bot



12/07/2018 16:38:53 +01:00 - darkcrys: a spreadsheat works; just worse



12/07/2018 16:38:54 +01:00 - spoon: *stares at the bounty stuff*



12/07/2018 16:38:55 +01:00 - Shivraj: and don't even compare him to Mitch and Tina lmfao



12/07/2018 16:39:09 +01:00 - chav: No, it's a fair comparison.



12/07/2018 16:39:11 +01:00 - darkcrys: I'm sorry, but the constant leaving made me switch them up



12/07/2018 16:39:25 +01:00 - Shivraj: he hasn't done anything to be put in the same light, I'm sorry.



12/07/2018 16:39:35 +01:00 - Shivraj: I agree, giving him back admin is a bit too reckless



12/07/2018 16:39:38 +01:00 - darkcrys: read my msg just above yours



12/07/2018 16:39:42 +01:00 - Shivraj: he's made a mistake



12/07/2018 16:40:03 +01:00 - darkcrys: I lost count how many times he left in the last 2 days



12/07/2018 16:40:24 +01:00 - spoon: twice



12/07/2018 16:40:41 +01:00 - darkcrys: And you don't see an issue with that?



12/07/2018 16:41:29 +01:00 - chav: Joe read the message in admin, saw the warning, and chose to leave anyway. When I dmed him about it his immediate response was that we were making the right call.

He was fully conscious of his actions; he didn't make a mistake, he changed his mind. We all know he has a history of dipping from staff when he's upset dating all the way back to lark's days. He knows he can get away with it.



12/07/2018 16:42:01 +01:00 - Shivraj: Dipping from staff?



12/07/2018 16:42:15 +01:00 - Shivraj: I don't understand



12/07/2018 16:42:20 +01:00 - Shivraj: <:GWnanamiRemThink:402195380894171146>



12/07/2018 16:43:29 +01:00 - darkcrys: he has been constantly leaving and rejoining a bit later or a day later for months already



12/07/2018 16:43:36 +01:00 - chav: Leaving the server, half the time posting an announcement, then coming back (with fanfare) a little later.



12/07/2018 16:44:04 +01:00 - darkcrys: or his many breaks and vacations that last a full 12 hours at best



12/07/2018 16:44:04 +01:00 - spoon: was he warned all those times when he did it?



12/07/2018 16:44:14 +01:00 - darkcrys: we told him to stop



12/07/2018 16:44:17 +01:00 - darkcrys: so many times



12/07/2018 16:44:21 +01:00 - darkcrys: but he shrugged it off



12/07/2018 16:44:42 +01:00 - chav: It was very much informal warnings: **last** time was his official warning.



12/07/2018 16:44:49 +01:00 - Shivraj: we only gave him an official warning one time, last time



12/07/2018 16:44:53 +01:00 - Shivraj: yeah



12/07/2018 16:44:56 +01:00 - darkcrys: That is all you should need



12/07/2018 16:45:16 +01:00 - chav: While there's no question that he's a competent programmer and a all-around good dude, I'm not allowing him to get off scott-free from this. He knew full well what would happen once he left and he did it anyway because he expects to be able to escape punishment



12/07/2018 16:45:27 +01:00 - Shivraj: so, your arguments are that we should just discard the bot?



12/07/2018 16:45:36 +01:00 - Shivraj: we can use spreadsheets, sure



12/07/2018 16:45:42 +01:00 - darkcrys: no, I'm saying we could afford to lose it worst case



12/07/2018 16:45:49 +01:00 - darkcrys: big difference



12/07/2018 16:45:55 +01:00 - Shivraj: and what do you propose happens?



12/07/2018 16:46:10 +01:00 - Shivraj: Since I can't budge you, I'll settle for hearing what you're thinking



12/07/2018 16:46:13 +01:00 - darkcrys: people panic for a few minutes, then realise they are here for the rp



12/07/2018 16:46:31 +01:00 - Shivraj: no, what do we do with everything?



12/07/2018 16:46:55 +01:00 - Shivraj: like, demote, promote, discard bot, transfer bot? etc.



12/07/2018 16:47:58 +01:00 - chav: With warnings of demotion, the general sentiment with mitchell/tina was that we gave them **one** warning before demoting. With myself, it was one warning, and I only got off because of how minor the leak was and staff jumping to my defence. It will not be different here.



12/07/2018 16:48:31 +01:00 - darkcrys: ^same went with me even after I somehow got that demotion turned into a first warning



12/07/2018 16:48:32 +01:00 - chav: And again, losing the bot is worst-case scenario. We have the code & hosting software, it can be up and running again at any time. Failing that, everything the rp bot can do can be achieved with normal bots.



12/07/2018 16:48:39 +01:00 - Shivraj: Dave, literally you were the one who wanted your demotion lmfao



12/07/2018 16:48:49 +01:00 - darkcrys: Actually



12/07/2018 16:48:53 +01:00 - darkcrys: I was the one pushing for it



12/07/2018 16:48:57 +01:00 - chav: Both of us were u dumdum



12/07/2018 16:49:05 +01:00 - chav: Because we follow principal



12/07/2018 16:49:06 +01:00 - Shivraj: you're an M, he's an S



12/07/2018 16:49:12 +01:00 - darkcrys: I'm a creature of principle



12/07/2018 16:49:13 +01:00 - Shivraj: what do you think would happen? <:GWnanamiFlanXD:399930881818624001>



12/07/2018 16:49:50 +01:00 - Shivraj: I still want him to write the bot.



12/07/2018 16:50:06 +01:00 - Shivraj: I think "Special Unique Bot" is a big plus point in our adverts



12/07/2018 16:50:35 +01:00 - Shivraj: so I'm very against discarding it. And I'd like it if we could keep updating it



12/07/2018 16:51:32 +01:00 - darkcrys: typing it up



12/07/2018 16:51:37 +01:00 - darkcrys: give me a sec



12/07/2018 16:52:08 +01:00 - Shivraj: Besides, I don't have much more time



12/07/2018 16:52:13 +01:00 - chav: Now. All of that being said, I'm alright with JC keeping staff and bot perms. Move RPBot below administrator, and let jcryer know that __this is his last chance.__ __Even though his last chance has come and gone.__

RPBot is the main appeal of keeping joe around; everyone knows how unstable he is. I will not have a second Orion.



12/07/2018 16:52:13 +01:00 - darkcrys: Actually, I have no problem with him getting staff. It is by far the easiest solution. (and bring bot below admin)

I'm saying that we **should** have a full demotion, but in all honesty, I'm too tired to deal with the fallout once more. 

The only reason I'm arguing is that you both tried acting like at least giving him staff was the **right and moral** thing to do and I wanted to hear how you would try to defend that as it is quite obvious bs.

Shiv, I can completely understand you and actually share the same sentiment as I also do want the bot, it easy.

Su, you disappointed me greatly with this embarrassing display of not even being able to back any of your arguments up and proving that you are purely acting on your emotions, something that any person in a leadership position shouldn't do.



12/07/2018 16:52:18 +01:00 - chav: oh snap



12/07/2018 16:53:10 +01:00 - Shivraj: No, it might not be the right or moral thing to do



12/07/2018 16:53:33 +01:00 - darkcrys: but it is easy and simple



12/07/2018 16:53:34 +01:00 - darkcrys: so yeah shiv



12/07/2018 16:53:35 +01:00 - Shivraj: but Ice knows that I like to adhere letter to letter



12/07/2018 16:53:35 +01:00 - spoon: <:FeelsDumbMan:460125686095413258>



12/07/2018 16:53:38 +01:00 - darkcrys: I agree with you



12/07/2018 16:53:41 +01:00 - Shivraj: to every rule



12/07/2018 16:54:05 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'm a heavy believer that humans need to have the better judgement to judge people based on the context.



12/07/2018 16:54:20 +01:00 - spoon: tfw you've just waiting to find the right words and arguments to make



12/07/2018 16:54:22 +01:00 - spoon: <:pepokms:463796868028301312>



12/07/2018 16:54:23 +01:00 - Shivraj: I guess I'm just too close to him to see your points, but I still think he deserves atleast the bot and a staff position



12/07/2018 16:54:38 +01:00 - Shivraj: agreeing to put our differences aside though



12/07/2018 16:55:04 +01:00 - Shivraj: we're all agreeing to

- promotion to staff
- keeps writing bot
- move bot below admin



12/07/2018 16:55:11 +01:00 - darkcrys: yes



12/07/2018 16:55:16 +01:00 - spoon: ~~i havent even-~~



12/07/2018 16:55:18 +01:00 - Shivraj: what changes if we move bot below admin?



12/07/2018 16:55:19 +01:00 - chav: His final warning.



12/07/2018 16:55:32 +01:00 - Shivraj: I think we can't mute admins, but that's about it?



12/07/2018 16:55:37 +01:00 - Shivraj: <@!139089329988435968> make your argument then



12/07/2018 16:55:39 +01:00 - darkcrys: it's my lack of trust coming into play for me.

I don't like the idea



12/07/2018 16:55:40 +01:00 - Shivraj: smh



12/07/2018 16:55:49 +01:00 - chav: He can't add himself to admin either & fuck around with our roles



12/07/2018 16:55:53 +01:00 - darkcrys: ^



12/07/2018 16:55:54 +01:00 - darkcrys: basically



12/07/2018 16:56:07 +01:00 - Shivraj: You two really lack trust in him <:GWnanamiEmiliaSMH:405043478028877824>



12/07/2018 16:56:08 +01:00 - darkcrys: It's low, but I don't like to take chances.



12/07/2018 16:56:13 +01:00 - darkcrys: I lack trust in everyone



12/07/2018 16:56:14 +01:00 - chav: But I can't let this slip under the rug. This is jcryer's last warning



12/07/2018 16:56:17 +01:00 - darkcrys: when it comes to shit like this



12/07/2018 16:56:18 +01:00 - Shivraj: I understand why



12/07/2018 16:56:25 +01:00 - Shivraj: you two haven't known him for as long as I have



12/07/2018 16:56:37 +01:00 - Shivraj: he may fuck around, but he wouldn't jeopardize anything



12/07/2018 16:56:39 +01:00 - Shivraj: but sure



12/07/2018 16:56:53 +01:00 - darkcrys: It's a precaution



12/07/2018 16:56:55 +01:00 - Shivraj: it's only a minor disadvantage, plus we can just manually do what the bot did for Admins



12/07/2018 16:57:09 +01:00 - spoon: nvm my point.



12/07/2018 16:57:09 +01:00 - Shivraj: well, I can



12/07/2018 16:57:11 +01:00 - Shivraj: <:GWnanamiSataniaEvil:407589583404924928>



12/07/2018 16:57:24 +01:00 - Shivraj: <@!139089329988435968> you sure you don't wanna?



12/07/2018 16:57:24 +01:00 - chav: shiv pls



12/07/2018 16:57:34 +01:00 - spoon: no point



12/07/2018 16:57:37 +01:00 - Shivraj: *watch me demote everyone so that I'm the majority* <:kappa:320948031891439617>



12/07/2018 16:57:38 +01:00 - spoon: im fine with these



12/07/2018 16:57:49 +01:00 - Shivraj: okie



12/07/2018 16:57:50 +01:00 - Shivraj: wonderful



12/07/2018 16:58:04 +01:00 - chav: - promotion to staff + keeps working as exp mod
- keeps writing bot
- move bot below admin
- his final warning



12/07/2018 16:58:10 +01:00 - spoon: ~~plus that didnt exactly help me with making my argument, as much as i appreciate honesty~~



12/07/2018 16:58:30 +01:00 - darkcrys: <@!139089329988435968> what was your argument even?



12/07/2018 16:58:34 +01:00 - Shivraj: should we keep a, uh, "cooldown" period?



12/07/2018 16:58:39 +01:00 - chav: Indefinite.



12/07/2018 16:58:42 +01:00 - Shivraj: no like



12/07/2018 16:58:46 +01:00 - spoon: well i was trying to think of the words



12/07/2018 16:58:47 +01:00 - Shivraj: "1 week demotion"



12/07/2018 16:58:50 +01:00 - spoon: but nvm



12/07/2018 16:58:51 +01:00 - Shivraj: "then back to staff"



12/07/2018 16:58:55 +01:00 - darkcrys: No need



12/07/2018 16:59:03 +01:00 - darkcrys: more trouble then it is worth



12/07/2018 16:59:20 +01:00 - darkcrys: but solid idea for more normal cases



12/07/2018 16:59:26 +01:00 - Shivraj: okay, bet.



12/07/2018 16:59:34 +01:00 - Shivraj: <@!199996479161630720> ?? you wanna say something?



12/07/2018 16:59:54 +01:00 - chav: Fine by me



12/07/2018 17:00:01 +01:00 - Shivraj: okay



12/07/2018 17:00:07 +01:00 - Shivraj: carry out the changes



12/07/2018 17:00:10 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'll put bot below admin



12/07/2018 17:00:27 +01:00 - Shivraj: done.



12/07/2018 17:00:30 +01:00 - Shivraj: now, I gotta study



12/07/2018 17:00:33 +01:00 - chav: Cheers. One of you two can tell staff the good news



12/07/2018 17:00:41 +01:00 - Shivraj: Uhhhh



12/07/2018 17:01:05 +01:00 - spoon: he keeps gm too or?



12/07/2018 17:01:42 +01:00 - darkcrys: No, in all honesty he isn't a good gm.
Avalon was Arena 2.0 and he didn't do anything gm-like after that or before that



12/07/2018 17:01:43 +01:00 - Shivraj: "We contemplated it, and thought that JC deserved one last chance, and that it'd be more trouble than worth it to completely demote him. So, he's demoted to staff, and the bot is moved below admin."



12/07/2018 17:01:55 +01:00 - chav: ^ good shiv



12/07/2018 17:02:03 +01:00 - Shivraj: okay, bet.



12/07/2018 17:02:16 +01:00 - Shivraj: posting it in <#329655620120608769>



12/07/2018 17:02:35 +01:00 - darkcrys: <@!124102469646024704> shiv, opinion on gm thing?



12/07/2018 17:02:57 +01:00 - Shivraj: frankly



12/07/2018 17:03:04 +01:00 - Shivraj: he can earn his way back up the ladder



12/07/2018 17:03:06 +01:00 - Shivraj: if he wants



12/07/2018 17:03:21 +01:00 - Shivraj: next time we hold GM tests



12/07/2018 17:03:26 +01:00 - darkcrys: perf



12/07/2018 17:03:29 +01:00 - chav: That's fair

12/07/2018 19:52:23 +01:00 - Shivraj: yo, darth wants a channel for an AMA he was planning



12/07/2018 19:52:31 +01:00 - Shivraj: temporary, seperate channel



12/07/2018 19:52:38 +01:00 - Shivraj: Can we spare one?



12/07/2018 19:52:55 +01:00 - spoon: Whats the overall topic



12/07/2018 19:53:47 +01:00 - Shivraj: literally anything



12/07/2018 19:53:53 +01:00 - Shivraj: except for personal info



12/07/2018 19:54:44 +01:00 - Shivraj: like bank account etc.



12/07/2018 19:57:04 +01:00 - spoon: Ah



12/07/2018 19:57:12 +01:00 - spoon: I mean we have the space



12/07/2018 19:57:17 +01:00 - spoon: But do we have the demand?



12/07/2018 19:57:51 +01:00 - darkcrys: why even an AMA?



12/07/2018 19:58:00 +01:00 - Shivraj: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯



12/07/2018 19:58:23 +01:00 - Shivraj: he's a pretty loved member, but an AMA out of nowhere is just so bonkers



12/07/2018 19:58:31 +01:00 - Shivraj: that I thought I might as well entertain it <:GWnanamiFlanXD:399930881818624001>



12/07/2018 19:59:52 +01:00 - Shivraj: Darth Tyrael - Today at 12:29 AM
was kinda bored so hoping I could do it like
before 2 hours from now



12/07/2018 20:02:20 +01:00 - Shivraj: he'll just use <#411164448120635393>



12/07/2018 20:04:54 +01:00 - Shivraj: nevermind



12/07/2018 20:06:30 +01:00 - Shivraj: god damnit discord



12/07/2018 20:28:28 +01:00 - spoon: Lmao



13/07/2018 17:23:24 +01:00 - Shivraj: are we gonna discuss the magicality of quirks?



13/07/2018 17:23:41 +01:00 - Shivraj: yes, I'm making up words now.

Fuck you.



13/07/2018 17:24:43 +01:00 - darkcrys: just allow everything



13/07/2018 17:24:52 +01:00 - darkcrys: as long as its balanced and works in freeform



13/07/2018 17:25:44 +01:00 - Shivraj: how do we deny something that's not balanced though?



13/07/2018 17:25:51 +01:00 - Shivraj: like



13/07/2018 17:26:02 +01:00 - Shivraj: outright "No." is apparently not enough



13/07/2018 17:28:18 +01:00 - darkcrys: we say no



13/07/2018 17:28:21 +01:00 - darkcrys: simple



13/07/2018 17:28:31 +01:00 - Shivraj: well okay, explain that to Alex



13/07/2018 18:52:46 +01:00 - darkcrys: Well so me and Davey will come clean. Our end goal will make Wayhaven close to un'rpable so with that in mind we came up with 4 options.

-Alternative timeline (basically go back in time and see how different things will be (all D rank again) (old OC's can be back if people want them back) (especially NM as he was a great thing for IC.)

-Just make a completely new world on the server, preferably fantasy (we can make it like a parallel universe and allow people to rp fantasy versions of old OC's

-We go to a new location and start over again there, no old OC's at all, but the same world.

-We keep rp'ing in that world, either way, fair warning it will fucking suck ( a mix between 1984 and Nazi Germany)

13/07/2018 18:55:24 +01:00 - Shivraj: hm?



13/07/2018 18:55:26 +01:00 - Shivraj: oh



13/07/2018 18:55:28 +01:00 - spoon: <:yikes:431111119235448852>



13/07/2018 18:55:36 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'm not in the mood sorry



13/07/2018 18:55:40 +01:00 - darkcrys: sure



13/07/2018 18:55:42 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'll give my input



13/07/2018 18:55:43 +01:00 - Shivraj: tomorrow



13/07/2018 18:55:48 +01:00 - darkcrys: No rush



13/07/2018 18:55:49 +01:00 - spoon: Nice



13/07/2018 18:55:49 +01:00 - Shivraj: you can discuss it if you want



13/07/2018 18:55:50 +01:00 - Shivraj: I just



13/07/2018 18:55:52 +01:00 - darkcrys: this is like a month away at least



13/07/2018 18:55:56 +01:00 - Shivraj: need some time alone rn, gonna go offline



13/07/2018 18:56:00 +01:00 - darkcrys: we just wanted to give a headsup



13/07/2018 18:56:02 +01:00 - spoon: Gl



13/07/2018 18:56:03 +01:00 - Shivraj: night



13/07/2018 18:56:07 +01:00 - spoon: Shiv



13/07/2018 18:56:09 +01:00 - spoon: Night



13/07/2018 18:56:16 +01:00 - darkcrys: gn



13/07/2018 18:56:59 +01:00 - spoon: And when you mean nazi / 1984, do you mean in the sense of "your ocs cant do shit and youre being constantly watched"?



13/07/2018 18:57:19 +01:00 - spoon: (Unless youre on their side?)



13/07/2018 18:57:56 +01:00 - spoon: 



13/07/2018 19:00:46 +01:00 - darkcrys: yes



13/07/2018 19:01:11 +01:00 - spoon: Ouch.



13/07/2018 19:01:26 +01:00 - spoon: I wont lie, the alternate timeline actually sounds kinda fun



13/07/2018 19:02:36 +01:00 - spoon: When you say the NM thing though. S rank NM or D rank NM? Also what if people want to have recent OCs with all the old ones (i.e: Old sol invictus but uhhhh idk. Kyoko is there)



13/07/2018 19:03:24 +01:00 - spoon: I know its just vague options rn but im curious



13/07/2018 19:03:31 +01:00 - darkcrys: Nah I actually got that one worked out a lot



13/07/2018 19:03:36 +01:00 - spoon: O



13/07/2018 19:03:38 +01:00 - spoon: Do tell



13/07/2018 19:07:56 +01:00 - darkcrys: recent Oc's just you know, just arrive/become active sooner /rewrite a bit of their backstory (deadwater escapees for example)

And NM would be

"After the death of mammoth there was an all out struggle over the control off the city between villains and heroes and all heroes and villains that were A rank or above died/cut their losses/heavily wounded and retired.

NM is the sole survivor but is heavily wounded. He can only use his quirk at full power for like an hour (aka he can't destroy the city anymore on his own) and also has like unlimited use of a C rank version of it."



13/07/2018 19:11:01 +01:00 - spoon: Would we reintroduce D rank? Or keep everyone at C



13/07/2018 19:11:58 +01:00 - darkcrys: I think D rank (0 xp) but to keep it fun C rank would already be at like 500-1000Xp



13/07/2018 19:12:19 +01:00 - spoon: Oh? So C rank is easier to obtain?



13/07/2018 19:14:39 +01:00 - darkcrys: all ranks should be in my eyes



13/07/2018 19:14:46 +01:00 - spoon: Mm



13/07/2018 19:14:52 +01:00 - darkcrys: to keep things rolling



13/07/2018 19:15:36 +01:00 - spoon: Well its easier now compared to when tina did xp, so I'm unsure about all ranks being lower



13/07/2018 19:15:47 +01:00 - spoon: But C rank being easier doesn't sound half bad



13/07/2018 19:16:02 +01:00 - darkcrys: I mean it wouldn't be much lower



13/07/2018 19:16:13 +01:00 - spoon: Ah



13/07/2018 19:16:19 +01:00 - darkcrys: it would just be that xp you don't need for C rank anymore



13/07/2018 19:16:23 +01:00 - darkcrys: deducted or something



13/07/2018 19:17:10 +01:00 - spoon: You confused me



13/07/2018 19:17:49 +01:00 - spoon: For just D > C?



13/07/2018 19:17:50 +01:00 - Shivraj: O



13/07/2018 19:17:53 +01:00 - Shivraj: h



13/07/2018 19:17:54 +01:00 - Shivraj: .



13/07/2018 19:18:13 +01:00 - spoon: 👀



13/07/2018 19:18:27 +01:00 - spoon: Also im now scared for what you guys have planned



13/07/2018 19:18:34 +01:00 - darkcrys: <@!139089329988435968> Now C is 750 - 2500

Then it would be 0-500
so all ranks after that would be lower obviously



13/07/2018 19:18:44 +01:00 - Shivraj: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j86fe_R3PWM



13/07/2018 19:18:48 +01:00 - Shivraj: MOU DAIJOUBU!



13/07/2018 19:18:51 +01:00 - Shivraj: Nazette?



13/07/2018 19:18:54 +01:00 - spoon: Ohh ok



13/07/2018 19:18:57 +01:00 - Shivraj: WATASHI GA KITA!

13/07/2018 19:19:19 +01:00 - spoon: Uh oh



13/07/2018 19:19:44 +01:00 - Shivraj: but, jokes aside



13/07/2018 19:19:51 +01:00 - Shivraj: idk how people will take to this



13/07/2018 19:20:15 +01:00 - Shivraj: cause it's basically *everything* they've done, retconned

+ the single biggest nuisance they've ever known back to almost his full power



13/07/2018 19:20:57 +01:00 - darkcrys: Not retconned 

it's like a fanfic basically where a few changes were made to the story, but that changed everything



13/07/2018 19:21:13 +01:00 - darkcrys: like this story will most likely have a "bad end"

13/07/2018 19:24:49 +01:00 - darkcrys: yeah same reasoning



13/07/2018 19:24:57 +01:00 - darkcrys: (I also like fantasy, but that is a big risk)

13/07/2018 19:42:29 +01:00 - Shivraj: yeah, but you gotta think of the people's sentiments, right?

Everything they've done just got up and retconned, cause they were too weak to stop the two big baddies



13/07/2018 19:42:55 +01:00 - Shivraj: putting the "Game Over. Try Again" spin on it might soften the blow, idk

14/07/2018 09:58:39 +01:00 - spoon: Oh. Building on from the topic of a "you were defeated. Try again" thing yesterday, maybe instead its "you were defeated. Try again or load a new save file?" 

And then hold a vote on whether or not people want a new location or to retry



14/07/2018 10:24:55 +01:00 - spoon: !userinfo Arel



14/07/2018 10:24:55 +01:00 - RPBot: 



14/07/2018 11:37:25 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'll be honest.

None of these ideas seem very pleasant to me.

Sure, I may get NM back, yay, I guess.

But it's not just about me. Most people wouldn't be happy about either being reset to D and being sent back in time where NM is there, or changing cities (and starting with new OCs?) or getting the server's theme changed to fantasy. Or, 1984 + Nazi Germany.

I'm very attached to WayHaven as a city, and it has good lore. Changing Cities means whole server revamp, every channel remade etc.

I guess I should be happy about getting NM back, but I'm gonna be honest, idk if have the energy anymore to take all the shit that comes with having NM as your OC at full S Rank glory. Besides, I don't even have an Arsenica anymore to RP daily with, lol, I doubt anyone would wanna RP with him, otherwise, so having him as an OC *might* limit me. Perhaps he could be brought back as an NPC, or something. Besides, getting kinda tired of being accused, directly or indirectly, of misusing my power, or being judged unfairly because 'I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth'. <:GWnanaFeelsPepoMan:392308457245769748>

I know we have better members now, though. Maybe it won't be that bad.

Idk where I was going with this, pardon me.

That being said, I'm still unsure what exactly happens if we change the city, could someone elaborate?



14/07/2018 11:44:54 +01:00 - spoon: ``I'm very attached to WayHaven as a city, and it has good lore. Changing Cities means whole server revamp, every channel remade etc.``



14/07/2018 11:45:01 +01:00 - spoon: pretty much this would happen with a new location



14/07/2018 11:45:15 +01:00 - spoon: + everyone would have to make new OCs



14/07/2018 11:47:44 +01:00 - spoon: and yeah, obviously its not the most pleasant of ideas



14/07/2018 11:47:56 +01:00 - spoon: but in all honesty, there's not much we can do to stop it, unless you (arbi and dread) want to change plans



14/07/2018 11:48:16 +01:00 - spoon: not in 1 month anyway



14/07/2018 11:49:37 +01:00 - spoon: right now, the general consensus on the server is "Dreadknight and Arbiter are both A rank and have Artemis working beneath them (who is also A) and our highest heroes are B and mostly inactive or inept in combat situations. We can't do anything to stop it. We can only suck up to them or hide."

14/07/2018 12:49:57 +01:00 - darkcrys: Every good story has an end



14/07/2018 13:02:07 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'm not saying it's necessarily bad



14/07/2018 13:02:14 +01:00 - Shivraj: In fact, this may even be healthy for the server in the long term



14/07/2018 13:02:26 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'm just saying it won't be very cheery if we're thinking of short-term



14/07/2018 13:07:54 +01:00 - chav: Time 4 salt

`like how the avalon thing going off without a hitch despite daed calling for help kappa
(but i dont understand half of what was happening so w/e)`

even if we omit dialup & time taken for guard to pick up the phone, daedalus literally couldn't make it past the first line within six seconds. He broke character to try and spite us at the last moment with a move he didn't even try to cover up (he didnt even turn the fucking phone's sound off for god's sake)

If people honestly believe we're unstoppable they need to take a step back and look at whether Daedalus' "plan" was actually thought out at all compared to the literal three months of leadup to this situation- which they only entered into after losing a fight against someone of equal rank to them, and were literally not going to lose their ocs. Joe could have done anything- even *send a fucking text*- and have snatched a victory, but instead he did the dumbest fucking thing he could and, surprisingly, it didn't work. He knew full well the risks and did it anyway without even stopping to proofread his reply

yeah, I could have waved my hand and let it go through, but it isn't fair on either side to arbitrarily hand out a victory out of pity or for the sake of a slightly different story. That's even more of a smack in the face after everything that had gone into the rp than killing daedalus- because it means that actions literally dont matter if they make sense, the gm can magic you a victory/defeat based on his mood. If you don't agree with the call, actually sit down and try to red Daedalus' reply aloud in under 6 seconds



14/07/2018 13:08:58 +01:00 - Shivraj: I think this is personal issues.



14/07/2018 13:09:32 +01:00 - Shivraj: I don't think we need to address this in the middle of an already perplexing situation



14/07/2018 13:09:45 +01:00 - Shivraj: both of you had your say, let's let it rest, now.

14/07/2018 13:13:08 +01:00 - darkcrys: Look I'm sorry but considering how the situation ended, we are a tad sensitive when people say things like that.
As we did our very best to make it fair, but then Joe ruined it for himself and the others and we won't take the blame for that



14/07/2018 13:13:47 +01:00 - spoon: I apologise then

14/07/2018 13:19:44 +01:00 - chav: u explain wiam

14/07/2018 13:19:57 +01:00 - Shivraj: stay safe



14/07/2018 13:20:03 +01:00 - spoon: bye bye



14/07/2018 13:37:45 +01:00 - darkcrys: "So this is how this timeline ends."

*Lateman was standing on the top of the Sol Invictus tower, the symbol he had tried to craft to guide humanity into a stronger and more advanced species.*

"This is the first time Humanity will survive the upcoming invasion, but can you call what remains of the species really humanity?"

*He let out a deep as he took a step forward, suddenly appearing in front of the now abandoned city hall.*

"When Alexandria died Arbiter lost the will to lead and the city collapsed like a house of cards. I knew the man was a wildcard, but even I didn't expect this bad of an ending."

*He waved his hands once as everything around him started to blur. Pieces of rubble flew back to the buildings they came from or sometimes simply disappeared.*



14/07/2018 13:37:55 +01:00 - darkcrys: "Let's try this again, shall we. The how manieth attempt is this already? When I let mammoth win, the heroes grew decadent and complacent, resulting in their downfall. When I let nightmare win, the ending wasn't much brighter than this one. When I killed them both the first forces of the Skree killed everyone and now when I introduced Lark to keep Nightmare in check Alexandria was the result."

*The clock on one of the buildings was actually spinning in reverse at a rapid pace as the cities landscape kept changing.*

"Now how shall I try it this time?"

*He ruined at the city, high ranked heroes and villains locked in combat as Nightmare stood victorious over Mammoth's corpse.*

"No lark, he ruined more than he succeeded in. Stellar and Silver Falcon were useless mistakes and so where most of the high ranks who did nothing all day."

*He waved his hand, causing time to speed up and a sequence of the high ranked villains and heroes killing each other to be seen. When it stopped only Nightmare remained with a massive hole in his chest.*



14/07/2018 13:38:05 +01:00 - darkcrys: "Nightmare can stay as a symbol of terror to take down, to spur the heroes into action, but we can't have him at his peak of power as he will be too strong to deal with and will only inspire powerlessness and hate."

*He touched Nightmare's wound, causing it to warp and deform.*

"This should serve as his limiter instead of Lark. Now to the newer generation. StarForger is too brutal and harmed more then she did good, it would be best for her to stay in Japan. Orion is too much of a leniency, he should be dead at the hands of Makato."

*He suddenly appeared in front of a small garage that had a happy old man reading the paper behind his heavy wooden desk.*

"Doting Baron was forced off the scene too early, he kept the heroes more under control so we have to make sure he doesn't stray from the right path."

*Once more the surroundings turned into a blur as he now stood next to a Boris who was frozen in time.*

"It seems that the equalizer that I introduced was a little bit too strong, let's make sure to keep the Russians occupied oversea's so that his presence will lessen."

*As she said those words he suddenly stood in front of Primus, the madman who had in multiple timelines already ruined the city.*



14/07/2018 13:38:31 +01:00 - darkcrys: "He can't come here yet as he will destroy what I was trying to build, if things go too smooth I'll throw him at the city, but for now he stays gone."

*He stood in front of three odd graves that read 'Fear Strikers' and simply laughed before waving his hands causing them all to fade into nothing as he tried to understand what he had been thinking at that point in time.*

"Now that all is addressed only two problem children remain, Julius White and Alexandria Argentum, the pair that ruined the last timeline. Julius should have never met Ur, to keep his morals a bit more intact and with Lark gone Alexandria should be fine as long as she stays away from Nightmare."

*He let out a final sigh as he appeared on the moon, glancing down at the entire earth.*

"Now the final order of business, let's just make these 'Quirks' I gave them a little bit stronger, they take too long to become stronger and time is not a luxury humanity can afford."

*He slowly stood up and started to walk away as she shook his head.*

"Also appearing in my true form was a mistake, I'll just stop the Skree invasion from happening all together so that I don't have to reveal my presence to save them. I don't want them to think that Tena can solve everything."

**===============Timeline end: Bad ending===============**

14/07/2018 13:47:04 +01:00 - darkcrys: give every OC 1 bit of meta knowledge, like a tiny fragment of the other timeline.



14/07/2018 13:47:13 +01:00 - Shivraj: I was gonna say that



14/07/2018 13:47:26 +01:00 - darkcrys: to make people happier



14/07/2018 13:47:33 +01:00 - Shivraj: yeah

14/07/2018 13:48:21 +01:00 - Shivraj: so, this is right after Mammoth died?

14/07/2018 13:49:20 +01:00 - darkcrys: and he still gets nm



14/07/2018 13:49:22 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'd rather not have him as an OC, or maybe have Indra as a secondary, or something



14/07/2018 13:49:29 +01:00 - Shivraj: idek anymore



14/07/2018 13:49:38 +01:00 - darkcrys: Mhh, I think Indra would be like Julius

14/07/2018 13:49:49 +01:00 - darkcrys: Julius was going to be an NPC at Deadwater in the future



14/07/2018 13:50:02 +01:00 - darkcrys: Indra can be a military soldier stationed in the city somewhere



14/07/2018 13:50:11 +01:00 - Shivraj: can he be a teacher at the academy? <:GWnanamiRemThink:402195380894171146>

14/07/2018 13:51:16 +01:00 - Shivraj: or just normally



14/07/2018 13:51:20 +01:00 - Shivraj: either works

"now you have a real chance to become a top dog"



14/07/2018 13:54:41 +01:00 - spoon: yosh



14/07/2018 13:54:43 +01:00 - chav: It's resetting exp, which is the real appeal.

14/07/2018 13:56:57 +01:00 - Shivraj: just going with time-leap?



14/07/2018 13:57:21 +01:00 - darkcrys: pull it down to staff first I would say



14/07/2018 13:57:24 +01:00 - spoon: ^



14/07/2018 13:57:28 +01:00 - spoon: was just about to say



14/07/2018 13:57:45 +01:00 - spoon: though i suppose we bring it to them closer to the nazi-ing?

2-3 weeks?



14/07/2018 14:00:00 +01:00 - spoon: <:yikes:431111119235448852>



14/07/2018 14:00:08 +01:00 - spoon: the real question is



14/07/2018 14:00:13 +01:00 - spoon: how the fuck does *dreadknight* die



14/07/2018 14:01:47 +01:00 - darkcrys: alien invasion at the end of the timeline, the thing he wants humanity to survive



14/07/2018 14:01:51 +01:00 - darkcrys: killed in action



14/07/2018 14:03:26 +01:00 - spoon: ...e-eh?



14/07/2018 14:03:36 +01:00 - spoon: wait in another timeline?



14/07/2018 14:05:37 +01:00 - darkcrys: no this is at the end of our timeline

14/07/2018 14:06:39 +01:00 - spoon: alien... invasion



14/07/2018 14:25:47 +01:00 - chav: Pretty much Tena wants humanity to join the galactic community and survive on their own merits. They need resets to manage to do that 

Nazi Germany would be one of the only civs to survive a proper invasion, but the end result would literally be worse than if the aliens had won



14/07/2018 14:26:05 +01:00 - spoon: <:yikes:431111119235448852>



14/07/2018 14:40:56 +01:00 - Shivraj: ok bet I get you



14/07/2018 14:41:01 +01:00 - Shivraj: but this is all worst case scenario



14/07/2018 14:41:10 +01:00 - Shivraj: if your plan succeeds



14/07/2018 14:41:31 +01:00 - darkcrys: Shiv how do I say this....



14/07/2018 14:41:35 +01:00 - Shivraj: is there a possibility that it can actually be hindered?



14/07/2018 14:41:36 +01:00 - darkcrys: it's a very mean plan



14/07/2018 14:41:45 +01:00 - spoon: what can be hindered

14/07/2018 16:15:48 +01:00 - spoon: also maybe like



14/07/2018 16:15:58 +01:00 - spoon: since we're most likely "restarting" the world



14/07/2018 16:16:13 +01:00 - spoon: would we be able to fiddle with bits and pieces to combat what sage pointed out?



14/07/2018 16:17:24 +01:00 - darkcrys: yes

"Now the final order of business, let's just make these 'Quirks' I gave them a little bit stronger, they take too long to become stronger and time is not a luxury humanity can afford."``



14/07/2018 16:19:53 +01:00 - spoon: ohh



14/07/2018 16:19:59 +01:00 - darkcrys: That is one part

14/07/2018 16:23:43 +01:00 - chav: Players have shown they don't always take the initiative themselves. Hnv's formula relies entirely on villains moving first



14/07/2018 16:24:04 +01:00 - chav: Well, it doesn't, but people think it does



14/07/2018 16:24:09 +01:00 - spoon: ah, yes



14/07/2018 16:26:41 +01:00 - Shivraj: ok so does that mean we're basically incorporating the "fuel" system



14/07/2018 16:26:46 +01:00 - Shivraj: or something else?



14/07/2018 16:27:10 +01:00 - chav: Fuel system is just happening rn



14/07/2018 16:27:22 +01:00 - Shivraj: what's the "quirks get stronger" bit



14/07/2018 16:28:52 +01:00 - darkcrys: "We allow more bs and XP caps get lowered"



14/07/2018 16:29:17 +01:00 - chav: Basically quirks get dumber



14/07/2018 16:29:41 +01:00 - spoon: oh hell yeah



14/07/2018 16:29:42 +01:00 - spoon: 😩

14/07/2018 20:17:06 +01:00 - Shivraj: I'd leave two guilds for characters that have a benefit to be on both sides of the spectrum

14/07/2018 20:18:05 +01:00 - Shivraj: villains won't get accepted into hero guilds, would they?

14/07/2018 20:18:20 +01:00 - Shivraj: and heroes would have a hard time getting into villain guilds



14/07/2018 20:18:59 +01:00 - Shivraj: but they could do it, at the high risk that they get gangbanged. Like Mafia members who are actually moles for the police



14/07/2018 20:19:12 +01:00 - Shivraj: and then there are mafia moles in the police force. Heroes turned villain <:GWnanamiRemThink:402195380894171146>

19/07/2018 15:44:44 +01:00 - darkcrys: I'll be honest



19/07/2018 15:45:51 +01:00 - darkcrys: With the thing yesterday combined with now changing your opinion on a server-wide policy just because it would also benefit Dave and me is incredibly shifty and downright disappointing.



19/07/2018 15:46:42 +01:00 - spoon: hm?



19/07/2018 15:54:26 +01:00 - spoon: i was already wavering before that because of dave and someone else's point (i forgot). 
then sage mentioned you getting S rank loot, and considering this whole ordeal started partly because of normal ranked loot, something like that clearly wouldnt be good.  
Dre buying a B rank gun doesnt stand out that much; it's Dre. Plus he already got a gun from you guys so whatever, right?
But an already incredibly strong character buying something stronger (which is a smart purchase that covers their weakness or improves their strengths, etc) is obviously going to catch more people's attention and bring more conversation and arguments. it's not a matter of "oh its dave and liam", its a matter of "oh its a strong A rank" and partly "oh its Dreadknight".



19/07/2018 16:02:45 +01:00 - darkcrys: I'll be honest, I'm a paranoid person and getting jumped 4 **heroes** who have more than enough reason to not want the baddies to grow stronger, right after using resources I had laying around for a month and had never been complained feels quite suspicious. 

Combine it with the fact that we would be the ones seemingly most hurt by the rule, while the hero side would gain a massive advantage due to their numbers in the lower ranks also feels iffy.

I don't believe that this was your reasoning at that point in time, but frankly, I don't have to believe it, I simply need to trust you and convince myself, sorry if it looks like I'm seeing shadows.



19/07/2018 16:13:56 +01:00 - spoon: im a paranoid person myself so i cant fault you. 
also, i sort of agree with you on the heroes thing. The thing is (and what I've seen from being on both sides of the playing field), people tend to be more lax of what people on their own side have. 
For example, if Sin (or er... Psion as a more heroic example) was in the same position as Dreadknight, then it would probably be the same scenario but with villains calling him out instead. You're on the side of the stronger person / you're getting benefits from them so you dont really say much. I can't say this would happen 100%, but it seems somewhat likely.

Maybe the whole thing *was* brought up because heroes dont like you two being strong. I don't know cause personally that wasn't my reasoning. I was mostly being driven because of the times I got large bounties as Tao but couldnt buy any large things with it. Self-centered I know. But that's why my argument was fairly easy to break through when Dave discussed it with me, imo at least. 

But regardless, I'm sorry about the whole thing.  I'm getting back into the swing of things, so I'll be cautious of my intentions next time I want to take part in that sort of conversation. Just so I don't make any misguided judgements or baseless points.
