And I�m not talking about quirkless cane-wielding Doting Baron. I�m not talking about two-legged quirkless fencing Doting Baron either. Hell, I�m not even talking about 100-man strong two-legged fencing Doting Baron with the tightly packed pike square and longbow firing lines (with swiss mercenary discipline and being capable of both anti-infantry and anti-cavalry combat), equipped with his hardwood cane, spectral Knight, control of Arsenica and Sol Invictus, with Professor Layton�s DNA implanted in him so he has incredible puzzle-solving ability and can perform deductions that almost break the meta while being an expert in both fencing and renaissance warfare."

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer�s head. There�s also Rick�s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they�re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn�t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick�s existential catchphrase �Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,� which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev�s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I�m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon�s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ??\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It�s for the ladies� eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they�re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ??"

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I�m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You�re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that�s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little �clever� comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

Then, bend one arm in towards your body, as if you are preparing to sneeze into your sleeve. Keep the other arm straight.\n\n    Tuck your head down. Next tuck your forehead down towards the arm that is bent and touch your forehead to your elbow area as if you are sneezing into your sleeve or dabbing sweat off of your brow. Keep the other arm straight. Straighten out your arm after you dab your forehead on it.\n\n    Bang your head into your elbow. After you bring your head in towards your elbow, you can do a quick head bang motion (or two) before you straighten out your arm and switch sides.[5] Just quickly jolt your head forward towards your elbow. Head banging is generally considered safe, but keep in mind that is can cause injuries if you do it too hard. You can always skip the head bang motion if you have concerns.\n\n    Switch sides. You can repeat the dab multiple times on one side or switch sides. If you switch sides, then repeat the same dab movement on the other side with your other arm. For example, if you started by dabbing on your left side, then switch over to your right side. Keep switching back and forth along with the music.\n\n    Move around. You can do the dab movement with your upper body and move your lower body however you like. You can hop around, walk around, or wiggle your hips. You can also do other moves in between dabs, such as waving your fists in the air or moving your arms from side to side in front of you. Add your own flair and just try to make your hater's feel worse about themselves."

It took up like half the white board <a:xd:400474296134402048> By the time he got back, I was sitting at my desk pretending that nothign happened, but all my stupid classmates were staring at me (they didn't get the reference). When the sub asked \"who wrote this?\" i was trying really hard not to laugh and i stood up while making the same facial expression as the Troll Face meme and I asked \"problem?\" I was expecting AT LEAST one of my classmates to laugh, but nobody did (like i said earlier, they didn't get the reference). still standing, i thought of a new joke. I made the facial expression of Doge (a different internet meme) and I said \"much troll, very epic\" so everyone would get that it was a joke about the Troll Face. To my surprise, not a single person laughed, and after a few seconds of me waiting for everyone to get the joke, a kid said \"sit down faggot.\" I asked if he went on the **Four-Chan** forums because they made up that word, but he just looked at me like I was the stupid one. By now, pretty much the whole class was yelling at me to sit down and shut up. I took this opportunity to make a **Four-Chan reference**, so as a joke, I yelled \"FUCKING NORMIES\" (because that's what **Four-Chan** calls people who dont get memes) and ran circles round the desks with my arms behind my back like in anime <a:xd:400474296134402048> I got a lunch detention from the sub but it was worth it because i got to troll the whole class."
