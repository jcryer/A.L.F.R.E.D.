'''[[w:c:onepiece:Ope Ope no Mi|Room Control]]:''' The user is able to open a room (globe) and is able to control this room

Radius 5m from me. Only able to move things around (Nothing organic though so just stones, trash cans etc.) Cuts only extended and still blockable. Cuts are invisible. Can lift up to 40kg

He can sustain a room for 20 minutes (10 turns) before it completely disappears. After having created 5 rooms or used two rooms for the complete 20-minute duration, he will be drained of his energy and needs to cool down for at least 10 minutes (5 turns).

He's working on improving his stamina in order to sustain his quirk for longer.

===Example===

When creating his room he lifts objects (trash cans, stones, etc.) at his enemy to distract him and then slashing with his sword at a distance from like 5 meter.
