On the exterior, the hospital looks fairly big with large windows to view the inside. There are 2 signs in the front, that say "WayHaven General Hospital".

WayHaven General is governed by a policy that lets the staff treat patients indiscriminately, be it, Heroes or Villains. While within the hospital premises, no patient is permitted to accost another and all conflicts are to be put on hold until the hospital has been exited.

Failure to comply with hospital rules will incur the wrath of the sentry Droids

Boasting cutting-edge medical facilities and the best medics any and everywhere, WayHaven general is the best place to seek treatment and rehabilitation.

Rest assured that in the hands of the capable staff, you'll be good to go in no time!

Walter can create potions: substances with special properties such as enhancing physical and mental abilities and healing someone. Unlike Pristina, His ability is not limitless nor does it come without a cost. He can only heal non-fatal injuries with his potions. They cannot repair/restore severed limbs or body parts and when curing poisons/diseases, they work at a slower pace. Consuming too much of the potions in quick succession produces the opposite effect and leads to increased damage to the patient.Potions come in different forms of liquid, such as jelly, stew, brew, or even soup. They can also be made into solid form, often pills, powder, candy, and possibly drugs.
