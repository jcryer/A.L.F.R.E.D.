==Personality==
Really warm to people she trusts but is unsure of those she doesn't know. Usually likes to spend time alone reading or listening to music.
==Backstory==
Lost her dad in an accident involving a villain. That pushed her to become a hero so others won't lose people close to them.
==Quirk==
She can sharpen and extend her fingers. Those fingers also become hard as steel. She can extend 1 finger up to 1 meter. Her drawback is that fingers are the only thing she can extend and sharpen. Her body overall is normal.

'''Example:''' She can combine her 2 fingers and turn them into a meter long sword.
