== Personality ==
Servile, obedient, strict. A young woman who believes in discipline and would do anything for her master. “Please call me if you require my services, Master.”

If she uses her quirk she turns sadistic, aggressive, domineering and passionate.

These traits grow stronger if she absorbs more energy and stays like that for 3 hours. Even while she is like this her master comes first but the way she tries to serve them it is just a tad different and a lot more dangerous. “Come on you imbeciles get on your knees and wash your necks for my Master ordered your deaths!”

== Quirk ==
Anti-energy

Alexandria’s body contains a special type of energy that she can’t control. She can, however, give someone else a special form of this energy called a seal of command. This allows them to control her and her power. Once the power is given she can’t take it back. The power in her master’s body causes her to become obsessed with, and blindly devoted to her chosen Master. Calling this obsession love would be an understatement. Her master can't order her death.

The master can split the energy in his body to transfer her loyalty to another person for a predefined time or for an indefinite time. The new master will get all the rights as the real master but the real master’s order will still have a higher authority than the second master, also she won’t care for this master nearly as much as the real one. The original master can also reclaim this energy whenever they want.

In return for giving away her freedom, the master will act as a regulator her control the energy in her body.
