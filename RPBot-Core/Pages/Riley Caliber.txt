==​Personality==
Really wild and loud. Likes to party and is really outgoing overall. Once she gets anrgry really it's really hard for her to calm down.
==​Backstory==
<p style="font-weight:normal;">Always thought of herself as awesome and number 1. That's why she wants to show everyone that her dreams aren't just thoughts.</p>
==​Quirk==
She can turns her body parts in to weapons. As of now only thing she can do is turn her [[w:c:powerlisting:Weapon Hands|hands]] in to pistols. Right one in to magnum and left one in to Normal handgun. Her drawback is that once she turns her hand in to a gun and empties all bullets her hand will automatically turn back and she has to wait some time (4 mintues) to turn it back.

'''Example:''' She can turn her right hand in to Magnum and fire all the bullets. Then her hand turns back and she has to wait before using it again.
