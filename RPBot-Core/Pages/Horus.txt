Horus was discovered by [[Osiris]] during the time-skip. [[Osiris]] trained him, tortured him and made sure he suffered only to grow and become the ultimate tool for future use. Learning the truth about [[Osiris]], Horus came to [[WayHaven]] to enact his vengeance for the death of his parents upon him - only to find out [[Osiris]] is gone.

== History ==

Ahamon was a happy kid of a family of farmers within the village of Abu Kabir. When he was 14, his village was visited by [[Osiris]], who tested his newfound power, wiping out the entire village, except for him. 
He was fast asleep during the onslaught, but when he woke up, he wished he never had.
[[Osiris]] walked towards him, seeing the fury and sorrow in his eyes, but something more as well. The boy's left eye glowed with a golden light - a sign from the gods... Or so he thought.
He decided to take the boy in his care and train him under severe and harsh conditions to become the ultimate tool, giving him the nickname 'Babu' - the name given to [[Osiris]]' firstborn.
Afterwards, [[Osiris]] left for WayHaven, leaving the boy on his own.

Two years later, Horus still committed to his training, had learned the truth about [[Osiris]]. He came to [[WayHaven]], seeking his revenge. Hearing about his death left him void. Seeking another source of closure, he takes on any assassination mission as a gun-for-hire, as well as playing an important part in the cultist group: '[[Sons of Osiris]]' in order to keep a close eye on them.
