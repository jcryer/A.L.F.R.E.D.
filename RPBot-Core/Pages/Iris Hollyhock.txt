==Personality==
Iris loves to take care of others, sometimes to an excessive level. She fails to care about herself to a fault, as she will be focused on helping others without her own vitality in mind. Being very cheerful and determined, she usually manages to hit it off with many people. However, her determination can mean stubbornness, which gets her stuck in unfriendly situations.

==Backstory==
Iris' father had died fending off a villain, and her mother suffers from an incurable illness and is bedridden. After discovering her powers, Iris swore to become the best healer she could be, so that she'll be able to cure her mother. She also wishes to help her older brother Pablo, who had given up on being a hero when he witnessed their father go down on the job, as he had taken care of Iris instead of their mother who was unable to do so, so she can repay him for all the kindness he gave her by helping him regain his dream.
==Resources==
Iris' family is quite wealthy, but she spends sparingly as she knows that the rate of income is far smaller due to Pablo being the only one who makes money in the family now.

===Equipment/Weaponry===
Pistol, Knife, First-aid kit

===Specializations===
Medical knowledge
