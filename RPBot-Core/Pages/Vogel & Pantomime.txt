​Pantomime: has a true killer's instinct and is willing to go to any means necessary to accomplish her goals, whether it be through attacks, murder, or blackmail. She has a dry sense of humor, and treats her opponents like a cat would treat a mouse, allowing herself to be involved in playful banter to a small extent. She actually enjoys the prospect and thrill of killing.
==Backstory==
Vogel: is a former military gunman, dishonorably discharged and a renown thief all over WayHaven. he is the most successful robber of all and is often in the employ of the underbelly's worst when not seeking personal wealth and debauchery.

Pantomime: is a highly skilled assassin who works for the League of Villains. She is the daughter of Gamemaster. having had an unhappy childhood, she ran away from home to avoid her father's verbal and emotional abuse and worked in a brothel for some time as  a young adult.
