==​Backstory==

'''​[[w:c:powerlisting:Feline Physiology|Beast Physiology]]: '''He is a cheetah hybrid. That means he can do anything a cheetah can. He can run usually up to 64 km/h but he can do bursts that are 112 km/h. He also has really strong kicks because of his strong leg muscles. The drawback is same as a cheetah's. Once he starts running his heart accelerates at extremely high rate so he cant run for that long. He can run for about 4 minutes. Then he has to rest and maybe even eat to refill his powers. Continuous running will cause damage to him and maybe even death.

'''Example:''' He can speed up to his opponent and land a really strong kick followed by few really fast punches and then go back.
