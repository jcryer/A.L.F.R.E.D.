Sons of Osiris is a cultist group that follows in the villain [[Osiris]]' footsteps, engaging in cannibalistic rituals and human sacrifices in his name, praising him as their 'true God' while often in a psychedelic trance.

== Location<nowiki/> ==

Their main hangout is unknown.

== Trademark ==

Members of this group wear long black and red hooded robes and use ceremonial knives. More loyal followers become soldiers in more risky missions, often carrying out assassinations or massacres.



== Usage ==

The cult is a rather closed one. Those that are picked out are often kidnapped and brainwashed. When strong enough and refusing to join, they will be sacrificed or devoured. They may hand out contracts to the owner of the Samsara - Spices & Snacks shop: [[Akshaj Chadha]], who to this day remains their only physical contact to the outside world. Contracts often include (but are not limited to) kidnapping and drug delivery.
