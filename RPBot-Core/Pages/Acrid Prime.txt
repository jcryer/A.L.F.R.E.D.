Every kid was equal and friendly, he grew up happy as anyone could be living in an orphanage.

He felt pretty average and normal at the time, due to some of the amazing quirks he would constantly see around him. During the annual children's sports day his quirk awakened, he unknowingly mimicked the ability to turn his left arm into a liquid state. Ecstatic at his new ability, he wanted to try it and show to everyone. But the mimicry wasn't the only form it took, the moment he grabbed one of his friends acid began to spread slowly eroding his arm.

Afraid of what he was he secluded himself from people for several years. But it all changed when he got admission into WayHaven's hero academy. He trained day in day out, to near brinks of death, both his body and quirk in attempts to master them, to also master any quirks he takes in, promising himself to never harm another innocent again.

As the years went by and his confidence skyrocketed, he quickly became louder and outgoing as he met new people who supported him and a rival class mate with whom he now competes for the Top-Hero spot.

== '''Quirk''' ==
A rare type of quirk, Devil's Hand fires corrosive and concussive blasts from his left arm. If he touches you with it, he will also be able to manifest your quirk for a limited time (two-four battle rounds).
The concussive blast, probably the most powerful ability he has, is a blast of sheer power. The strength his based on his current mental state. At full power it can blast through multiple buildings. He is unlikely to reach full power unless due to an extreme mental situation, but he is usually level headed. With a 30-60 second time between each blast and with its normal strength being able to break through one building. Can release corrosion substance that surrounds him in a radius of max 5m, anyone that enters this radius will be severely burned and damaged. He can shoot his blasts at small repeated burst. Depending on how long he holds on to someone he is trying to absorb he can decrease the strength of their quirk while increasing it on himself

The corrosion affects his opponents depending on how long he holds them; longer the touch the more it damages and more permanent. A full minute would kill someone, half a minute permanent damage and less just leaves nasty burns.

Acrid can create a corrosive bubble shield around him for a limited amount of time depending on the acidic strength.

The longer Acrid holds on to his target the more his target's quirk is weakened.
