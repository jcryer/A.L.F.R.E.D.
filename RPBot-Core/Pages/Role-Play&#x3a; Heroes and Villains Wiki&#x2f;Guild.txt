== Guilds ==
Guilds are groups of characters that fight together. For heroes, imagine it as a company versus going at it by yourself. For villains, imagine it as a way to not die, align yourself with a powerful guild and you won't be squashed the moment you start gaining power.

=== <u>Guild Creation Prereqs</u> ===
* Reasonable amount of Role-play activity
* Pro Rank and reputation with substantial earnings
* At least, 4 active members to join the Guild upon creation.
* Registration with the appointed bodies (Heroes use their HQ while Villains will need permission Staff members)
* Percentage Wage agreement between owner and members (to be submitted to and approved by the appointed bodies/individuals)
