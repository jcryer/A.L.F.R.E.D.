Summoning Red Queen.

She can summon The Red Queen whenever she wants but to summon it away she has to throw it in the air. The weapon transformation from a sword to the sniper rifle takes 2 seconds. Sniper shots can pierce concrete but cannot steel. The blade is made out of normal steel. The rifle has to be reloaded once every shot so that means it's single fire sniper. It also can be reloaded in its sword form. If the transformation from sword to the sniper rifle or back is interrupted by an attack the weapon falls apart.
