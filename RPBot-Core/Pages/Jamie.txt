==Backstory==
Jamie was part of a military like group of quirkless people. Led by the hero Recoil, he was trained in both fire arms and hand to hand combat in order to apprehend Quirk users. Was a valuable solider and Hero, that is until Recoil died and gigs military group disbanded because of a lack of funds. Jamie tried to do solo hero work, but without a group to back him up, he found himself to old and too weak to go against quirk users. Settling down for run of the mill jobs, such as working for the school as a substitute and bus driver for the Hero Academy, and eventually getting a family. But a part of him still wishes to get back into the fight. Maybe too big a part.
