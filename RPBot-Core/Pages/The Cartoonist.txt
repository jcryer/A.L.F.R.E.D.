=== '''Quirk''' ===

'''Out of the Inkwell''' - This transformation quirk completely covers him in ink, making him into a terrifying ink figure. This form allows him to become stronger (13k N punch, 15k N kick) and faster (37 mph) than before, as well allowing him to slow the momentum of a direct hit once it connects with this form (i.e. weakens the power of the hit. The durability of this is like concrete). The drawback is if he stays in this form to long (i.e. an half an hour), his form will start to dissipate until he is nothing but an ink puddle. If he was uninterrupted, it would take him a half hour to gather enough strength to regain his form.

'''Equipment/Weaponry'''
'''Weapon:''' Axe

'''Equipment:''' Several inkwells, old fountain pen

=== '''Specialization''' ===
Armed Combat

=== '''Versatility''' ===
Quick thinker
