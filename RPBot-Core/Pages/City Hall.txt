== Located at One City Center ==
City Hall is the headquarters of the WayHaven Council & Authority (WCA), which comprises the [[Mayor]] and the Assembly. It is located in the very center of the city and bears the clock tower as well. It was intricately designed to be the most sophisticated and futuristic edifice in the city by Avalon's leading scientist at the time, Dr. Gibbons, in the year the WayHaven Council & Authority was created.
