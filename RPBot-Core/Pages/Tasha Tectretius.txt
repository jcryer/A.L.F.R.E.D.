==Personality==
Cold, Manipulative

==Backstory==
An orphan girl whose parents died shortly after she was born, Tasha left the orphanage suddenly one night, after deciding to try and work to earn a comfortable and easy life. Hardworking, Tasha had a somewhat twisted personality. Not afraid to step on others if it benefits her. After hearing about the Hero Academy, Tasha realized it may be her best chance at earning a comfortable life, and decided to sign up.

She is currently suffereing stage 3 lung cancer.
==Resources==
Almost nothing.

===Equipment/Weaponry===
Street clothes and an antique rifle when possible. The rifle allows her to control the aim of her quirk drastically better.

===Specializations===
Long range combat.

==Quirk==
Blessed Light

Example: Can fire a power ball of light that creates a large explosion upon impact. Can be aimed and fired out of her rifle similar to a bullet. However she must have a weapon to use it, and the type of firearm changes how it comes out. Example: Automatic weapon = Less power, higher fire rate. At this time she can only create a large enough explosion with her quirk to break concrete.
