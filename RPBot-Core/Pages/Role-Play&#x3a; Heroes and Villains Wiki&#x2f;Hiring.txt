== Hiring ==
Any person can hire another. Guilds tend to make missions for their members. Members tend to seek missions themselves by deciding to hunt/go after someone or something. Everything is done through Role-play. Most Guilds create Mission boards for the members. Players can also hire players.

Guilds are paid more, however, Guilds have the agreements to take pay the members a percentage of the income they bring in from each mission and apply. If a member was paid $25,000, and his Guild got $50,000, an agreement of 50% profit dispersal would earn the player another $25,000.
