==​Personality==
Kaminari is a very unpredictable individual, He seems to run on an unlimited supply of energy as he is always Energetic and never seems tired or sad.

Kaminari's morality is something questionable, while he seems to be a nice guy on his way to becoming a hero, he's completely fine with being friends with assassins, murderers, or anything of the sort as long as he likes them.

He however can hate a Hero who only does good because of a single action. Once his mind is set on a task his mind doesn't turn anywhere else, he would focus 100% of his brain capacity to finish said task no matter what he has to do.
==​History==

Kaminari's parents saw him as the perfect child that could be created, they prized him above all his siblings, giving him whatever he desired and sending him to the most prestigious schools money could get. Kaminari was never fazed by any of this, loving his life normally never caring about material things and only caring about things if they effected him.
