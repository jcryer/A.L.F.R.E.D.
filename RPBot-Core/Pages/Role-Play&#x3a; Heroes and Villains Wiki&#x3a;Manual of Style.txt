==General==
Read these rules. If there is anything even ''remotely'' confusing take it up with me, @Raven#4608. 
==Character Page==
*'''[[Template:Character|Infobox]]''' - Use the Character infobox ONLY. Any others will either not work or are outdated.
*'''Personality''' - Personality/Mentality section. (Heading)
*'''Backstory''' - Backstory AKA History section. (Heading)
*'''Resources '''- Resources section. (Heading)
**'''Equipment/Weaponry''' - Guns/Swords/Armor that kind of stuff
**'''Specializations''' - Combat, other training, hacking....
*'''Quirk''' - The power. (Heading)
**'''Versatility''' - The explanation of the quirk, and how flexible it is. (Heading 2)
**'''Example''' - Only to be used for an actual example. If it's an explanation of the quirk, do NOT put it under example (even if the user did)

=== Marking a person as deceased: Put them in the Deceased category. Add the template:===
*Type this at the top: <nowiki>{{Deceased}}</nowiki>
*It will look like this: {{Deceased}}
==Categories, take one from each:==
*[[:Category:All Characters|All Characters]](every Character page MUST have this. If it doesn't, assume it still needs to be reformatted)
* [[:Category:OC|OC]], [[:Category:NPC|NPC]]
* [[:Category:Villains|Villains]], [[:Category:Rogues|Rogues]], [[:Category:Heroes|Heroes]]
* [[:Category:OC Villains|OC Villains]], [[:Category:OC Rogues|OC Rogues]], [[:Category:OC Heroes|OC Heroes]], [[:Category:NPC Villains|NPC Villains]], [[:Category:NPC Rogues|NPC Rogues]], [[:Category:NPC Heroes|NPC Heroes]]
* (If applicable) [[:Category:1st Year Student|1st Year Student]], [[:Category:2nd Year Student|2nd Year Student]], [[:Category:3rd Year Student|3rd Year Student]], [[:Category:4th Year Student|4th Year Student]]
** 4th Year Students are typically [[:Category:Sidekick|Sidekicks]] as well, there are some special cases.
== Images ==
*They should always, ALWAYS start with the person's character. 
*Don't use spaces, or special characters like ['] or [-]
*Add 1,2,3 or add a descriptor like Suit or Sword or both!
*Replacing images? https://youtu.be/4cc7wYm7ekg

== Guild Page ==
*'''Infobox''' - Use Guild infobox ONLY. Don't use character, what are you thinking?
*'''NAME''' - The name of the guild, and what the guild is.
**'''Purpose''' - Purpose section
*'''Wages''' - Percentage cut of wages
*'''Resources '''- Resouces/Property section.
*'''Headquarters''' - HQ
*'''Strength '''- Average ranking
==Places==
