=== The Maker ===

The Maker is simply the moniker of brilliant inventor and gadget Heroine, Vanessa Lee. She serves as the visitor's guide at Avalon and is also responsible for the contrivance of the unique contraptions that are constantly sold at the facility.

Once a side-kick of the ingenious electric Hero [[SteamShock]], her abilities and skill are remarkable and she will almost certainly make anything within the reasons of what exists on the server.
