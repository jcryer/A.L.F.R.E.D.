'''[[w:c:powerlisting:Soul Transferal|Soul Shift &nbsp;]] '''

I transfer my soul and leave my physical body to control an inanimate object, such as a doll. This will leave my physical body unconscious. I activate this quirk by looking at a certain object. The object can only be at least 50 meters away from me. I can return to my physical body by saying “Release [Object]”. I can only transfer into objects smaller than my physical self. I only feel pain as the object, my physical body is unharmed. 

Quirk time limit: 12 hours. If I do not release the object, I'm stuck inside the current object. And, destroying the object I possess, I will automatically return to my body.

Current known object transfer time: 5-10 mins.

=== Example ===
I can look out the window and transfer my soul into a bush and eavesdrop on the neighbors talking about their plans on Friday. If the neighbors plan to drop something on the bush, I will feel pain in the bush. My unconscious physical body is unharmed.
