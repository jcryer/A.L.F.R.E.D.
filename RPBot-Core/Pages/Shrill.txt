Sound Manipulation

He creates, shapes and manipulates sound waves with his voice which can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. At low frequencies, it may cause internal damage and death. Sound is an invisible, deadly and versatile weapon which can travel through any medium making defending against it (using physical barriers) difficult.
