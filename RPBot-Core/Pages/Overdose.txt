==Personality==
A grown up who doesn’t take most things to serious. Despite his hard childhood he still is a happy go lucky man. He dislikes combat and will most of the time try to avoid fighting unless someone is in danger. But beware under the guise of the silly and goofy doctor still hides a ruthless man that won’t care about justice or mercy when pushed hard enough.
==Backstory==
Yu Jekyll grew up in a low class area. One day a robber, who wanted some quick cash, broke in while his father was out drinking with his friends and fatally wounded his mother before running away. He tried to use his quirk ‘Drug creation’, which grants him a of knowledge about organic chemistry and the human/animal bodies, to save his mother but failed because he had never tried to make a healing drug before. A few weeks after the incident his father committed suicide because he blamed himself but not before attacking Jonathan, who he blamed for not wanting to save his mom, resulting in a few scars around his mouth. He and his sister were placed into an orphanage. A lot of people wanted to adopt his younger sister but thanks to his scars, both mentally and physically, no one wanted to adopt him. He later told the orphanage to allow people to adopt his sister without having to adopt him. A few days later his sister got adopted. He stayed his whole live in the orphanage and later was able to get a doctor degree at the age of 18 by relying on his quirk. He later learned that his mother’s killer was let off the hook because there was a mistake in court. This knowledge drove him to develop a poison that he called ‘Hellfire’, which causes someone’s blood to slowly start boiling, cooking them from the inside out and killed the man with it. After coming back to his senses he was horrified with what he had done. He covered his tracks as good as he could, fled the country and then became a doctor who just wants to save as many lives as possible, even criminal lives.
