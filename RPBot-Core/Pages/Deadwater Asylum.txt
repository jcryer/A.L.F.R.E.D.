[[File:DeadwaterAsylum.png|thumb|left|Deadwater Asylum, as seen from offshore Carthage Island]]Deadwater Asylum is a maximum-security prison which houses the many rogues and superhuman criminals of WayHaven City when captured. Located about three miles north of WayHaven and only accessible by a retractable bridge and sometimes by flight, Deadwater Asylum is known for its vicious and brutal treatment of its prisoners. Under the ruthless authority of the current Warden, Marx Wolfe, a former prosecutor, Deadwater has become a living "hell-hole" to those in the prison.

Possessing a personal hatred for the supervillains, Wolfe instituted a lockdown system in the building, and guards were ordered to shoot any prisoner on sight if they were trying to escape or caught outside the prison. Also, the prisoners are beaten on a daily basis. Wolfe has the superhuman ability to tense up others' muscles, which he uses on the prisoners making them suffer cramps or discomfort that forces them to halt until his power dissipates.

The supervillain prisoners are jailed in an area known as "the Silent Gallow." The Silent Gallow is the dark, dank basement of Deadwater where the prisoners are treated under awful living conditions with little food or water. The prisoners are kept in their costumes so the guards can identify them immediately. Guards have orders to shoot any "mask" spotted outside the Silent Gallow. Despite these harsh conditions and the ruthless warden, breakouts have and still often occur in Deadwater. It's all about creativity and skill.
