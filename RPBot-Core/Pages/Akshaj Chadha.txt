Owner of the [[WayHaven|Samsara - Spices & Snacks]] shop (located in the Providence market district), he comes across as a rather domineering yet caring fatherly figure. He has a odd habit of 'blessing' the food or spices given to his customers, who oddly enough seem to experience its effects.

== History ==

Not much is known about the history of Akshaj. However, his shop wasn't always this succesful. His most recent success appeared to happen during the invasion, where people sought after this miraculous healer and his magical spices. Rumored is, however, that he expanded his interests into something far worse than spices.
