==Quirk==
[[w:c:powerlisting:Mind Link|Connect the Dots ]]

Physical contact to the skin automatically activates quirk. Touching clothing won’t activate quirk. 
This allows user to become “synced” with the person(s). This only affects the user, therefore the thoughts and actions of target(s) goes to the user. In other words, only the user can hear the thoughts.
Connect Four- This also allows user to sync four people together. This allows the four and the user to share thoughts. This move lasts for 5 turns. After the 5 turns the effect disappears, disconnecting the four and the user. Or user will come into contact with another person, this will also deactivate Connect Four.
===Drawbacks===
User’s energy burns out easily after continuously connecting people. This makes user more tired.. Connect The Dots cannot be deactivated, therefore user tends to avoid physical contact as much as they can..To erase or “disconnect” people, user must sleep for at least 6 hours, undisturbed.. User also suffers from headaches…

User in a crowd--A lot of physical contact is made. User is connected to each and every person they made contact with. This confuses user, because multiple voices and thoughts of different people. The result is a really bad headache. 
User in a small crowd--Not as much physical contact will be made. User is able to make out some thoughts from others…But it’s still confusing…(edited)
Connect Four-- After coming into to contact with exactly four people, connect four is automatically activated. This allows the user and the other four. to share thoughts. Once the number of contacts exceeds four people, the quirk deactivates. Or when user comes into contact with another, this will also deactivate Connect Four.

Connect--User is only connected with one person. Any action(jumping, raising right hand, etc..) person does, user will mimic. Ex. Person jumps, So does the user. If the user jumps, the person will not.
