Calm guy, helping where he can.

'''Metal control:''' Can control and shape up to 50 kg (110 lbs) of metal. Smallest possible is the size of a marble which he can fire as fast as a bullet. Can fire as much metal as he want, but it will corrode overtime and he cant focus on anything else while controlling

Example: Magneto from X-men.
